## üéØ Usage

### Main Menu
```
[1] Generate Strong Password
[2] Check Password Strength
[3] Encrypt Text
[4] Decrypt Text
[5] Exit
```

### 1. Password Generator

Generate cryptographically secure random passwords:

- Customizable length (8‚Äì64 characters)  
- Choose character types (lowercase, uppercase, digits, symbols)  
- Uses `secrets` module for cryptographic randomness  
- Guaranteed character diversity  
- Strength analysis with entropy and suggestions  

**Example:**
```
Password length (8-64): 16
Include lowercase? (y/n): y
Include uppercase? (y/n): y
Include digits? (y/n): y
Include symbols? (y/n): y

[SUCCESS] Password Generated Successfully!

 aK9$mP2@xL5#qR8! 

Strength Analysis:
  Level: Very Strong
  Length: 16 characters
  Entropy: ~104 bits
  Lowercase: Yes
  Uppercase: Yes
  Digits: Yes
  Symbols: Yes

Copy password to clipboard? (y/n): y
[SUCCESS] Password copied to clipboard!
```

### 2. Password Strength Checker

Analyze password security:

- Length analysis  
- Character diversity check  
- Entropy calculation (~bits)  
- Strength rating: Weak / Medium / Strong / Very Strong  
- Actionable improvement suggestions  

**Example:**
```
Enter password to check: mypassword123

Password Strength Analysis

Password: mypassword123

[Medium] Overall Strength: Medium

Length: 13 characters
Entropy: ~51 bits

Character Types:
  Yes Lowercase letters (a-z)
  No  Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  Yes Digits (0-9)
  No  Special symbols (!@#...)

Suggestions:
  - Add uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Add special symbols (!@#$%^&*...)
  - Increase length to 16+ characters for better security
```

### 3. Text Encryption

Encrypt sensitive text with AES-256-GCM:

- Option for random key or custom key (min 8 chars)  
- Secure key derivation via PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (480,000 iterations)  
- Authenticated encryption (GCM mode prevents tampering)  
- Base64-encoded output  
- Key and ciphertext copied to clipboard on request  

**Example:**
```
Enter text to encrypt: Hello, World!

[SUCCESS] Encryption Successful!

Original Text:
Hello, World!

Encryption Key:
 MySecureKey12345 
Save this key! You'll need it for decryption!

Encrypted Text:
gAAAAABl1x2Y3R...K9m3pQ==

Copy key to clipboard? (y/n): y
[SUCCESS] Key copied to clipboard!
Copy encrypted text to clipboard? (y/n): y
[SUCCESS] Encrypted text copied to clipboard!
```

### 4. Text Decryption

Decrypt previously encrypted text:

**Example:**
```
Enter encrypted text: gAAAAABl1x2Y3R...K9m3pQ==
Enter decryption key: MySecureKey12345

[SUCCESS] Decryption Successful!

Original Text:
 Hello, World! 

Copy decrypted text to clipboard? (y/n): y
[SUCCESS] Decrypted text copied to clipboard!
```

## üõ† Technical Details

### Encryption

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)  
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256  
- **Iterations**: 480,000 (OWASP recommendation 2023)  
- **Salt**: 16 bytes, randomly generated per encryption  
- **Nonce**: 12 bytes, randomly generated per encryption  
- **Output**: Base64-encoded (salt + nonce + ciphertext)  

### Password Generation

- **Randomness Source**: `secrets` module (CSPRNG)  
- **Character Pool**: Up to 94 printable ASCII characters  
- **Entropy**: ~6.5 bits per character (full pool)  
- **Diversity Guarantee**: At least one character from each selected type  

### Clipboard Support

- **Library**: `pyperclip`  
- **Cross-platform**: Windows, Linux, macOS  
- **User Control**: Explicit confirmation before copy  
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if clipboard unavailable  

### Security Features

- Cryptographically secure random number generation  
- Authenticated encryption (prevents tampering and replay)  
- Proper key derivation with high iteration count  
- No hardcoded secrets or keys  
- Memory-safe operations (no plaintext logging)  
- Secure clipboard interactions
